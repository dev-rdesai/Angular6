This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.1.

## Development server

Does currently not work.

## Build

Run \src\tsc.exe my.module.ts (that will create my.module.js)

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

Maybe we need to update <base href="/"> in our index.html (e.g. <base href="/ngx-dynamic-module-loader/">)
